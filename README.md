# 1. Terminal-Based Maze Solver

## Objective

The Terminal-Based Maze Solver is a Python application designed to generate random mazes, find a path from the start to the end, and visualize the maze and its solution in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming language.
- Familiarity with terminal-based input/output.
- Installation of the `colorama` library (for terminal color output) - you can install it via pip: `pip install colorama`.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YashaswiniJawalkar/Masai_Projects.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd Rat_maze
    ```

3. **Run the Application**

    Execute the Python file:

    ```bash
    python Rat_maze.py
    ```

## Code Structure

- `maze_solver.py`: Main Python file containing the maze generation, pathfinding, and user interaction logic.
- `colorama` library: Required for terminal coloring of the maze and path.

## Functions

- **Maze Generation Function**: Generates a random maze and ensures there is a path from the start to the end.
- **Maze Printing Function**: Prints the maze in the terminal with colors for walls, open spaces, start, and end points.
- **Pathfinding Function**: Implements a BFS algorithm to find a path from the start to the end.
- **Path Printing Function**: Prints the path in a readable format.
- **Path Marking Function**: Marks the path on the maze for visualization.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Colorama library
